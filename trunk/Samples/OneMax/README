The OneMax Problem is a simple problem consisting in maximizing the
number of ones of a bitstring. It is one of the most used test bench
in evolutionary computation because it is simple, unimodal (has only one global
optimum), separable (can be solved for each bit independently), and the definition of the fitness function is quite straightforward.

* Base

Simple 1-max problem. Please note that the evaluator can evaluate any
number of individuals of arbitrary length in the same invocation
(ie. concurrentEvaluations may be > 1).


* Assembly

The goal is to generate an assembly function that writes 0xFFFFFFFF (32
1's bit) to register eax. The secondary goal is to minimiza the size of the function.
