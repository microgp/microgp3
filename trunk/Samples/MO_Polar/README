Multi-objective maximization of two, independent quantities.

Individuals encode two real values: rho [1, 100] and theta [0,
Pi/2]. The two components of the "fitness" are calculated translating
the polar coordinates into Cartesian ones. I.e.,

x = rho * cos(theta)
y = rho * sin(theta)

Useless, as many examples, but it is pretty easy to see the Pareto
Front here...

The evaluator can evaluate any number of individuals of arbitrary
length in the same invocation (here concurrentEvaluations is set to
50).
