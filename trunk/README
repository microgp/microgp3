MicroGP (ÂµGP, uGP, ugp, &micro;GP) is a versatile optimizer able to
outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics in finding
the optimal solution of hard problems. Given a task, it first fosters
a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhance
them. Its heuristic algorithm uses the result of the evaluations,
together with other internal information, to efficiently explore the
search space, and eventually to produce the optimal solution. MicroGP
has been devised in 2002, and subsequently developed thanks to the
effort of several people.

MicroGP original application was the creation of assembly-language
programs for testing different microprocessors, hence the Greek letter
micro in its name. Afterward, it has been used on a wider range of
problems, such as: creation of test programs for pre- and post-silicon
validation; design of bayesian networks; creation of mathematical
functions represented as trees; integer and combinatorial
optimization; real-value parameter optimization; and even creation of
corewar warriors.

MicroGP is an evolutionary algorithm, hence the acronym GP (genetic
programming) in its name. A population of different solutions is
considered in each step of the search process, and new individuals are
generated through mechanisms that ape both sexual and asexual
reproduction. New solutions inherit distinctive traits from existing
ones, and may coalesce the good characteristics of different
parents. Better solutions have a greater chance to reproduce and to
succeed in the simulated struggle for existence.

The current implementation is version 3, also known as MicroGP^3, ugp3
(due to typographic limitations) and MicroGP++ (being written in
C++). MicroGP^3 is free software: it can be redistributed and modified
