Now, I patched the logging by:
a) creating an ostringstream that ConsoleHandler will use to dump all the text to;
b) at the end of every function, calling a method that reverses the content of the ostringstream to the textEdit inside the GUI.

It's not superclean, and I wonder whether there is a way to trigger a signal everytime the ostringstream is written to...
