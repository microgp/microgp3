# To generate Makefiles use the command: cmake .

# Tip:
# If you want to build ugp3 using Eclipse you can use the generator: -G"MinGW Makefiles" 
# that generates Makefiles suitable for MinGW; then you can import the project into Eclipse using the
# import command "Existing projects into Workspace"
