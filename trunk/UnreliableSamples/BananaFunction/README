WHTAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This demo shows the ability of MicroGP in solving simple mathematical functions.
The Rosenbrock banana function is used. It has a global minimum of 0 in (1,1).


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting MicroGP to solve the problem, you need to compile the evaluator.
Type 'make' from the root directory of the microgp project. This will
compile the evaluator of this sample.


HOW TO
~~~~~~

After compiling the evaluator, run MicroGP in the directory 'Samples/Banana'.

You can change the parameters in the xml settings file to try different 
evolutive behaviours.
