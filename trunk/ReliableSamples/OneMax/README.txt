OneMax
------
OneMax is a classical toy problem: a candidate solution is represented by a string of bits. The fitness is the number of bits set to 1 inside the string. In this example, the string has length 50, so the globally optimal solution is a string featuring 50 bits set to 1.

Running OneMax
--------------
In order to run OneMax, you need to have a Perl interpreter installed on your system. Perl is installed by default in many Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu). Once Perl is installed, you just need to run ugp3 inside the OneMax folder.
