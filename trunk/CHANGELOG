ugp3 version 3.3 (Camellia)
===========================

For a detailed list of improvements, see http://sourceforge.net/p/ugp3/wiki/Changes%20introduced%20in%20Camellia/

GENERAL
-------
- MicroGP is now C++11 compliant
- The self-adapting mechanism that manages operators' activation probabilities has been improved with the state-of-the-art Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit logic
- The "info" (basic) log now displays more information, in particular
	-- relative (%) size of the tournament selection with respect to the population
	-- total number of evaluations (calls to the evaluation program) so far 
	-- if the steady state stop condition is set, number of generations with no improvement of the best solution
- Lots of bug fixing

multiObjective
--------------
- Multi-objective optimization fixed and improved with crowding distance (NSGA-II like)
- "eliteSize" parameter in "multiObjective" populations now indicates the number of fronts to preserve, rather than the number of individuals; for example, eliteSize=1 makes individuals on the Pareto front immortal

Population Inspector (alpha)
--------------------
- A Qt-based GUI companion program called "Population Inspector" is added to the project
- Population Inspector allows the user to explore population XML files (e.g., status.xml)
- Individuals are shown in a table, with their ID, parents, operator and fitness values
- Population statistics (e.g., size, offspring size, current activation probabilities of the operators) are also displayed
- Single individuals in the population can be selected and saved to a text file
- WARNING: this software is still experimental, it *is* unstable and it *will* crash frequently. Qt4.8+ libraries are required to compile and run it. 

Individual Editor (alpha)
-----------------
- A Qt-based GUI companion program called "Individual Editor" is added to the project
- Individual Editor allows users to manually create and add individuals to an existing population
- The aim of the program is to assist users by seeding the initial population with existing candidate solutions
- Individuals are created and edited through a "wizard"-like interface
- WARNING: this software is still experimental, it *is* unstable and it *will* crash frequently. Qt4.8+ libraries are required to compile and run it.
